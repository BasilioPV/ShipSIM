# ShipSIM
Modelica library for Naval Architecture simulations.

ShipSIM package has the aim to provide Modelica models relative to Naval Architecture, specially to perform 6 DoF simulations, propulsion systems, electrical plant, engines, etc... to enable designers a true Model-Based Engineering (MBE) based on open source solutions.

Through decades of investigation, naval architecture knowledge was documented in natural language on papers, books, thesis and other scientific publications. The rise of CFD programs in the last decades, looking for a generalized solution, puts all this knowledge in the background. But CFD calculation times are not adequate for the real-time simulations required by digital twin technology.

Mature acausal simulation languages, such as Modelica, enables the use of all this knowledge in a practical way to develop an trusted, easy to maintain and reusable simulation library.

This library remains under heavy development and exhaustive validation is needed to gain confidence on the results. Nevertheless, the library is based on state-of-the art publications coded by Naval Architects that ensure a correct implementations of the background physics.
